***1. General information
- You can change tab by selecting one in the menu at the top. The default one is "Today".
- The default update interval of the timer is 5 minutes. This means time will be added to the timer only every 5 minutes. To change this, see number 4.
- When the app is closed, times are saved.
- If the app is open and the date changes, the times are saved to the day they were recorded.

  by a coma and a space: ", " (ex: "YouTube:Youtube, reddit:Reddit" 1st app name is "YouTube" and 1st shown name is "Youtube", 2nd app name is "reddit" and 2nd shown name is "Reddit")
